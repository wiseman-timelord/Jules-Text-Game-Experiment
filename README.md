# Jules-Text-Game-Experiment
Status: Alpha

Description:
This project is an experiment in creating a procedurally generating text adventure game. The goal is to build an infinitely explorable world rendered entirely with ASCII art. The player can roam freely, and new segments of the map are generated on the fly as they venture into unknown territory. The current version establishes the core engine and basic gameplay mechanics.

Features:
- **Procedurally Generated World:** The game world is composed of individual map "chunks" that are generated as the player enters them, creating a unique and near-infinite landscape to explore, currently populated with simple rocks and bushes.
- **Player Exploration:** Navigate the world using the arrow keys. The game remembers previously visited areas.
- **Dynamic Map Screen:** Toggle a high-level map view with the 'm' key to see which parts of the world you have discovered.
- **Planned Biomes:** The architecture is designed to support different environments, with plans for Urban, Outlands, and Wasteland biomes.
- **Standalone Installation:** Includes simple installer and validator scripts to set up the environment and dependencies.

Notation:
- There is also new "OK Computer" by `Kimi.Com`, I'd like to see what it would do also.
- Jules updates  to a new branch, main is updated manually from the Jules branch.
